## Uni-lemma Overlap on CDI:WS Forms

Number of overlapping concepts on each pair of CDI:WS forms.
American English has the highest average degree of overlap (468 uni-lemmas), which may be driven in large part by it being the oldest form, from which many others were adapted.
The form with the lowest average degree of overlap is European Spanish, with only 325 uni-lemmas shared with other forms, on average.

## Word Difficulty by Semantic Category and Language

```{r semantic-cats-by-lang, fig.width=10, fig.height=18, fig.align = "center", set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=2, fig.cap = "Mean difficulty of CDI words by semantic category and language. Bars represent bootstrapped 95\\% confidence intervals."}

## Cross-linguistic similarities 

We look at the Spearman correlation between the item difficulty of each language compared to each other language. 
We might expect this to recapitulate the historical relationship between languages, with more similar languages having more similar item difficulties (e.g., Quebecois and European French).

```{r xling-sim, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=2, fig.cap = "Cross-linguistic similarity (Spearman correlation) of IRT item difficulty from the CDI:WS."}
# parm diffs in low- vs. high-data langs
#t.test(xldf$d, xldf_lowd$d) # -.45 vs. -.02 (closer to prior of 0 in low-data langs)
#t.test(xldf$a1, xldf_lowd$a1) # higher discrim in high-data langs

tmp <- get_cross_ling_difficulty_cors(xldf)
prod_cors = tmp$prod_cors
prod_sims = tmp$prod_sims

Colors = brewer.pal(11,"Spectral")
diag(prod_cors) = NA

#pdf(file="xling_difficulty_similarity_WSprod.pdf", width=13, height=13)

## Evaluating Thresholds for Inclusion on Swadesh CDI

It is unclear how many existing forms a uni-lemma should be included on in order for it to be considered for inclusion on a Swadesh CDI. 
Instead of setting an arbitrary threshold, we chose to try all possible values of $k$ (i.e., number of forms on which a uni-lemma is included, $k \in \{2,..,26\}$), and chose the $k$ which yields the set of Swadesh CDI (S-CDI) items with the highest total test information.
The table below shows test information for each threshold, with the highest S-CDI test information achieved by $k=9$ (66577).

```{r, echo=F}
#load(here("data/Swadesh_grid_search_final.Rdata")) # mean-.5sd threshold
load(here"data/Swadesh_grid_search_1sd.Rdata")) # mean-1sd threshold

swad_tab <- swad_agg %>% filter(sublist=="Swadesh") %>%
  filter(language!="French (French)") %>% # test info is WAY high -- something fishy
  mutate(k = as.factor(k)) %>%
  group_by(k, N, mean_diff, mean_sd, sd_sd, sd_thresh, swad_n, swad_mean_diff, swad_diff_sd) %>%
    summarise(N_avail = mean(N_avail),
              `S-CDI vs CDI:WS` = mean(sumscore_cor), # want sd(sumscore_cor) and sd(test_info) ?
              `S-CDI Info` = round(mean(test_info),0))

rand_tab <- swad_agg %>% filter(sublist=="random") %>%
  filter(language!="French (French)") %>% 
  mutate(k = as.factor(k)) %>%
  group_by(k) %>%
    summarise(`Rand vs CDI:WS` = mean(sumscore_cor), # want sd(sumscore_cor) and sd(test_info) ?
              `Rand Info` = round(mean(test_info),0))

grid_tab <- left_join(swad_tab, rand_tab) %>%
  relocate(`Rand vs CDI:WS`, .after=`S-CDI vs CDI:WS`) %>%
  relocate(`Rand Info`, .after=`S-CDI Info`)

grid_tab %>% select(-swad_diff_sd) %>%
  #mutate(d_diff = mean_diff - swad_mean_diff,
  #       info_diff = round(`S-CDI Info` - `Rand Info`,0)) %>%
  rename(`Mean d` = mean_diff, 
         `S-CDI pool` = swad_n,
         `S-CDI Mean d` = swad_mean_diff,
         `S-CDI per form` = N_avail) %>%
  kableExtra::kable(digits=3) %>%
    html_table_width(rep(72, ncol(swad_agg)+2))
```


## Swadesh CDI vs. Full CDI:WS

For the 26 languages that the IRT models were trained on:

```{r, results='asis'}
load(here("data/Swadesh_comparisons.Rdata"))

#xx_tab <- xtable::xtable(xx, digits=c(3), 
#                       caption = "Swadesh CDI vs. Full CDI:WS scores for 26 training languages.")
#print(xx_tab, type="html", comment = F, table.placement = "H", include.rownames=FALSE)

xx %>% kable(digits=3, caption="Swadesh CDI vs. Full CDI:WS scores for 26 training languages.") %>%
  html_table_width(rep(70, ncol(xx)))
```

### Generalization Test

Comparison to the eight low-data languages, with the 10 additional difficult words added.
Note that many proposed Swadesh items are not actually on the CDI:WS forms available to test generalization. 

```{r, results='asis'}
#gen_tab <- xtable::xtable(gen_xx_ext, digits=c(3), 
#                       caption = "Swadesh CDI with difficult words vs. Full CDI:WS scores for 8 generalization languages.")
#print(gen_ext_tab, type="html", comment = F, table.placement = "H",
#      include.rownames=FALSE)

gen_xx %>% kable(digits=3, caption="Swadesh CDI with difficult words vs. Full CDI:WS scores for 8 generalization languages.") %>%
  html_table_width(rep(70, ncol(gen_xx)))
```


## Swadesh-CDI Items

Below we show the full list of 229 Swadesh CDI uni-lemmas, along with their average cross-linguistic difficulty (d_m), variability in difficulty (d_sd), number of CDI:WS forms they appear on (n, out of 26), semantic category, and lexical category. The semantic and lexical categories are based on American English, as uni-lemmas sometimes appear in different categories on different forms, as appropriate.

```{r}
#swad_freq[1:50] # appearing on 22-25 Swadesh lists
#swad_freq[51:100] # 18-22 lists
#swad_freq[101:153] # 14-18

# 8 words appeared on all 25 lists: airplane, cold, dirty, door, key, sing, TV, wait 
# 18 words appeared on 24 of the 25 lists: ant, banana, cat, dance, doctor, dog, eat, finger, lion, milk, mommy, moon, nose, paper, telephone, tongue, tooth, yes -- all of which on k=9 list

good_prod <- swad_lists[[9]]

en_good_prod <- good_prod %>% 
  left_join(xldf %>% 
              filter(language=="English (American)") %>% 
              select(uni_lemma, category, lexical_category)) %>%

## Guide to Developing a Swadesh-based CDI

Developing a CDI for a new language is a substantial task -- even with the new Swadesh-CDI recommendations.
Many recommendations and caveats have been enumerated by the CDI Advisory Board, here: [https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html](https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html)
Rather than repeat the process specified, we suggest how the Swadesh CDI can be used to jump-start the process.

1. As a starting point, take the above 229 uni-lemmas, and consider their linguistic and cultural appropriateness for the target language. Include as many as are relevant.
2. Consider adding uni-lemmas that are frequently included on other CDIs, and especially focus on categories that are less well-represented on the Swadesh CDI, including question words, quantifiers, helping verbs, and pronouns. We recommending adding 10-20 items across these categories.
3. Do a pilot study, including several children at the upper and lower intended ages, and revise if there are many children at floor or ceiling.

## Comparison of Swadesh CDI Concepts to Other Lists


28 of the Swadesh CDI candidates are on the 100-item CDI:WS short (form A), and 26 of the Swadesh candidates are on the WS short (form B).
(Actually lower than expected by chance? 27%, and we have selected 34% of the length of the EN CDI:WS)
26 Swadesh CDI concepts are also on the original Swadesh-100 list---and 12 are overlapping with the ASJP (a subset of the Swadesh-100 that performs as well as the Swadesh-100 for purposes of glottochronology).
